# Memphis
Cross-platform GUI and Event System

Philosophy

0. The system will work with a minimum number of lines (3 lines: create, set up, use)
1. Protect users from memory leak (remove explicit new and delete)
2. It's easier to turn off a function than to turn it on
3. Warn user about possible problem
4. Make simple simple and difficult in simple pieces
5. Beautiful library code (no extra__ and gibberish)
6. Easy to build: everything in the header file
7. . instead ->
8. Anything Memphis can do automatically is done automatically
